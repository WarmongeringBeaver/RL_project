# README

*Most of the code is shamelessely stolen from the excellent [OpenAI Baselines GitHub repository](https://github.com/openai/baselines).*

1. Go to the poetry [website](https://python-poetry.org) and [install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. Run `poetry install` in the project directory. 

2. Run the notebook.

3. Behold the learning curves in the "Training" section of the notebook, together with the videos of the Rainbow agent in the `videos/rainbow` folder.
